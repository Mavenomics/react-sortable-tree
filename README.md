# STOP!

This is a forked version of React Sortable Tree to work around a version issue
in react-dnd. If you're using RST in a top-level package (ie, you don't intend
to distribute it on NPM), then you should use an override mechanism such as
[Yarn resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/)
instead.

See the original project here:

https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree

To install this patched version, use:

`yarn install fixed-react-sortable-tree`

or

`npm install fixed-react-sortable-tree`
